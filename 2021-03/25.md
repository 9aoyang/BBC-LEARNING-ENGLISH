# Vanilla

F: It's very hot today, Rob. What a good idea to present this programme outside in the lovely sunny weather!

R: Yes, it is - and what a great suggestion that I buy you an ice cream!

F: Thanks, Rob!

R: So come on then, what flavour do you want - chocolate, strawberry, salted caramel...?

F: Vanilla for me, please. It's my favorite flavour _of_ ice cream.

R: Vanilla? That's a bit boring, a bit ordinary.

F: It's just ice cream, Rob - but the word 'vanilla' can be used to describe something that is basic or bland. So vanilla ice cream is very popular because it is delicious. But your taste _in clothes_ is just...

R: Vanilla, thanks. I think we should hear some examples.

E: I thought his performance in the movie was very vanilla - he's normally amazing.

E: I'm just looking to buy a vanilla car - nothing fancy, no _extras_, just something to drive to the shops _in_.

E: I wanted to go sky diving with my friend, _but_ he's so vanilla - _he'd_ never do anything risky.

F: So, come on then, Rob. If my vanilla ice cream is so 'vanilla', What flavour are you going for?

R: It's got to be salted caramel.

F: That's so vanilla. Everyone is eating salted caramel _flavoured things_ these days.

R: Well, luckily for you. _I've forgotten_ to bring any money - so no ice cream for _either of us_.

F: Oh well, back to work then.

R: That's vanilla, too - it's such a lovely day, shall we stay in the park a little longer?

F: Yeah, good idea. See you, everyone.
