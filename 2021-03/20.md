# Bog-standard

R: Do you need me to order you a pizza?

F: Why would I want you to order me a pizza when we are presenting a programme?

R: Oh, go on. Just say 'pizza', and my new smartphone will instantly order one for you.

F: I see. I know you've got a new and very expensive smartphone, Rob. But I'm quite happy using my bog-standard _dumbphone_.

R: Bog-standard? You mean it's basic, _ordinary_, and _unexceptional_.

F: I do, Rob. It's a strange expression and nobody really knows its origins.

R: Well, I think it's _got_ something to do with _the_ English _slang_ for _toilet_ - bog - which is where your old phone should be.

F: Thanks, Rob. Shall we hear some 'bog-standard' examples now?

E: I've got a bog-standard computer, but it's fine for just sending emails and surfing the internet.

E: Sorry you got a low mark in your homework, but to be honest, it was bog-standard.

E: I found the new film bag-standard. It _lacked_ the actions and _special effects I was expecting_.

R: Yes, like your basic mobile phone.

F: Oh, is that a message on your new, shiny, very expensive smartphone?

R: Yes, yes it is. It's my first bill for my new phone. Let's have a look. What?! How much? Oh!

F: Oh, dear Rob. It's not such a new, shiny phone now, is it?

R: Oh no, how are we going to order a pizza now?

F: On my bog-standard phone? Here, just press the numbers and you can actually talk to someone.

R: No, I'm not hungry now.
