F: R, why are you hitting that table with a hammer?

R: I got your message about flattening the curve, and then I _saw that_ this table had a bit of _a_ bump _in it_. So I wanted to make sure you were happy.

F: No, R. When I talked about ’flattening the curve‘, it relates to _lowering and smoothing_ out the peak on a graph or chart.

R: Oh, because you were talking about the rate of infection in the UK. It's really important to flatten the curve of the infection to avoid _our_ healthcare services being overwhelmed with too many patients at one time.

F: That's right. Now let's listen to these examples

E: The government has introduced social distance measures to try and flatten the curve.

E: We need to flatten the curve to prevent too many admissions _into_ hospital.

E: Flattening the curve is vital to help save lives.

F: Which has been used a lot during the coronavirus crisis. It means to reduce the peak of a graph or chart.

R: Yes, people have been _in_ lockdown and social _distancing_ to flatten the curve. It seems that the rate of infection in the UK has decreased of late.

F: Yes, it seems that way. But I can't believe you were hitting the table.

R: Well - I was just trying to make you happy - sorry.

F: Roy, now my chair was broken. What happened to the wheels?

R: I flatten the curves on your wheels, I've fixed everything - you should see what I've done to your car.

F: Working with you is never a boring experience.
