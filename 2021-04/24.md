# Is It a Couch or a Sofa?

This week on Ask a Teacher, we answer a question from _Abid_ about something a lot of people have in their living rooms. Here is what he says:

Hi, I have a question: What is the difference between "couch" and "sofa"?

In my living room, I have a long piece of furniture covered in cloth. Sometimes, I call it a "couch." Other times, I call it a "sofa."

In the United States, the words "couch" and "sofa" are generally _interchangeable_. That means either word is used to describe this piece of furniture, which a person can sit or lie down on.

A Google _ngram_ of the two words tells us that, in the U.S. today, the words are about equally common, with "couch" being a little more popular.

Historically, however, the meanings were different. The word "couch" comes from French word "_coucher_" and once meant a low, _bed-like_ piece of furniture that did not have arms. And the word "sofa," which comes from _Arabic_, was something more like a bench with arms and a back.

Today, the American public uses either word, whether or not the piece of furniture has arms. However, some people consider the word "couch" to be less formal than "sofa." And sofas might sound as though they are more costly and refined than couches.

It is worth noting that some industries only use the word "sofa." That includes furniture designers, makers and sellers as well as home decorators.

And that's Ask a Teacher for this week.
