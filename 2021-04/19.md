# Dr Jill, I hear you're going on a trip next week.

Yes, I'm going to the _Ski Lanka_ and India. I haven't been there in ten years.I love the elephant rescue center.

Are you study the languages they speak there?

You know me pretty well!

I did learn some _tamil_, but they speak English there, too.

Of course. It's a bit different, isn't it?

Yes, they borrow some words from _hindi_, like my favorite stop - _the chai wallah_. You've been to South Africa, haven't you? They English is different from ours, too.

I was surprised when my friend said he pick me at 7 o'clock for dinner.

And when I lived in Japan there were some English words I didn't understand.

You've traveled a lot - what do you think _of all these_ different ways to speak English?

I think they're great!

It's interesting to hear how people have made English fit their own culture. The experts called these _varieties_ World Englishes.

So many my students ask, "How can I sound like an American?" I tell them, "Be proud of the way you speak English."

Yes, we like hearing people with different ways _of_ speaking English.

Now I can tell them, "You're speaking a World Englishes. Be proud of it!"
