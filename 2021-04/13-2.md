# Make and Do - 4 things to remember

Today I'm going to tell you how to use make and do. Now, they can be tricky and there are some exceptions. Here are 4 things to remember. We use make when we create something, like this cake. We use do to talk about an activity.

What are you doing?

I'm doing some work.

We can use make to talk about something that causes a reaction. This music really makes me want to sing! We can also use do with general activities.

What are you doing tomorrow?

I'm not doing anything. Have you got any plans?
