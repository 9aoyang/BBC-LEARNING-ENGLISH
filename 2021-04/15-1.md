# Stop to do vs stop doing

What's the difference between stop to do and stop doing something?

Well, stop what you're doing right now because that's what I'm going to tell you.

When we use stop plus ING, the activity in the ING form stops. So, I have stopped drinking coffee. I'm not drinking coffee any more. I'm only drinking water.

But when stop is followed by infinitive, it _means_ we stop doing another action to do the action in the infinitive. So, I stopped to buy a tea this morning - I stopped walking in order to buy a tea.

Right I'm going to stop talking now. Write me a comment and tell me something _that_ you've stopped doing.
