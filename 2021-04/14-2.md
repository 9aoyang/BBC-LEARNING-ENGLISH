# Five ways to use hard

Today we are looking at 5 ways to use the word hard.

As _an_ adjective describing a thing, it can mean the opposite of soft. For example: Wood is hard.

The opposite of easy. For example: The exam was hard.

And it can mean something that involves effort: Running a marathon is hard.

As an adverb describing an action, it can mean to do something with energy, such as: She works hard.

Or to use force. For example: He hit the ball hard.

Just be careful not to confuse _it_ with hardly because that has a different meaning.

So not too hard, is it?
