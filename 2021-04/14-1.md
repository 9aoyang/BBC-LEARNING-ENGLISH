# History vs Story

Today I'm going to tell you the difference between those two confusing words history and story.

So, both words are _used_ for a description of events. So that _makes them_ the same, right? WRONG! They are not the same.

History is the description or study of past events based on fact, often to understand their _consequences_. 'Christopher Columbus arrived in America in 1492.'

A story is the description of a series of real or imagined events, often to entertain people. 'After arriving in America in 1492, Columbus and his _crew_ were attacked by a _giant man-eating T-Rex dinosaur!_' That didn’t happen! It’s just a story.

So, history is the description of past events based on fact and stories are descriptions of real or imagined events, often to entertain.

Leave _us_ a comment _below_ about a piece of history or an imagined story from your culture! We'll try and guess which is which!
