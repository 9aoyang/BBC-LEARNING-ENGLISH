# Must vs have to

Today, I'm going to tell you the differences between must and have to.

Both must and have to talk about obligations. However!

Now, we use have to when we talk about obligations others decide for us. It's a law or a rule, so it cannot be changed. For example: At BBC, we have to show our passes to enter the building. This is a rule decided by BBC.

On the other hands, we use must when we talk about obligations we decide for ourselves or others. For example: My boss might says to me: You must be more organised. Or, I might say to myself: I must exercise more often.
